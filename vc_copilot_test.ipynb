Use Cases Features Customer Stories About Log in DE Use Cases Features Customer Stories About telli raised $3.6M to build the next-gen call operations platform hello world This is Seb, Finn, and Philipp - the founders of telli. We started telli 8 months ago with the mission to let humans and AI collaborate in call operations. Today, we are announcing our pre-seed round of $3.6M led by Cherry Ventures and Y Combinator.Â Since launching in November, we've processed  to a million calls for our customers, experienced strong demand across industries including real estate, energy, healthcare, financial services, and have assembled a fantastic team in the process. If you are interested in seeing how telli can also help your business, please reach out directly here: https://hi.telli.com/hello . If you want to become part of our team, we are hiring across roles here: https://careers.telli.com/ . Below we want to share with you a bit more background on telli, what makes the telli product special, and why you should be part of this journey either as a customer or team member. telli's insight Finn and Philipp were employees number one and two of the heat pump unit of Enpal, one of Germanyâ\\x80\\x99s energy unicorns, where we helped scale the business to 150 people in its first year. We found our perfect match with Seb, who studied computer science at Stanford and was an early engineer at Pitch. At Enpal, we got to know what it means to build phone-based customer acquisition processes. We worked at the heart of a massive, call-center-like sales floor - surrounded by hundreds of reps with old school headsets and thousands of calls per day. That hands-on experience gave us an unfiltered insight into the challenges with phone-based customer communication that is shaping telliâ\\x80\\x99s product: managing performance across tools and dealing with fluctuations in demand and workforce - all while building a great customer experience across thousands of daily calls - is very difficult. We have poured that experience into developing a product that does not just produce a great-sounding voice demo, but that actually brings AI voice into real-world workflows that deliver outcomes. Beside our own insight, our collaboration with initial pilot customers was critical to achieve this. The result is a platform that resonates with the market. In the last 3 months, we have seen revenue growth of more than 50% month-over-month each month primarily coming through inbound channels or referrals. telli's product telli empowers businesses to make phone calls with AI voice agents, converting and engaging customers across the customer journey - solving a critical bottleneck in high-volume customer acquisition. From day one, we designed the product around achieving outcomes - enabling AI voice agents to collaborate seamlessly with human teams to qualify leads, book appointments, and even win customers.

       " 'founding_story': \"Finn and Philipp previously worked together at Enpal, managing contact center operations for the company's heat pump unit. They likely leveraged this experience to understand the challenges in traditional contact centers and saw an opportunity to innovate with AI voice agents. Seb, with his background in computer science from Stanford and experience in software development, joined them to form telli. Together, they founded telli in 2024 to build AI voice agents for B2C companies, aiming to revolutionize customer communication.\",\n",
